# FinLearn
This project is a financial literacy web platform for youth and underserved communities. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and SQL, it features an orange-themed UI with login/signup, goal-based modules (investing,crypto), interactive lessons, quizzes, and dashboards. Future updates may add gamification, badges, and community features.
